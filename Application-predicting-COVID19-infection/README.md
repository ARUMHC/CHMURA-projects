### Abstract
The moment the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 occurred, people started using machine learning in order to help in managing the situation. Our work is a build up to research described in (Yan et al. 2020c) and in (Bello-Chavolla et al. 2020) articles. We improve and create new models predicting COVID-19 mortality based on blood parameters and analyze original models presented in the articles. We train a prediction model calculating risk of getting infected with the virus depending only on person’s sex, age and chronic diseases and created an application which calculates the COVID-19 mortality risk based on input data and explains the model with visualizations. Considering accuracy of the model, calculations based only on chronic diseases may not achieve best results but we propose a transparent machine learning approach which doesn’t need any additional medical information, is explainable and easy to understand and requires only data that everyone has access to.
