# MI2 Data Lab Summer Intership

My main task during the summer intership in MI2 Data Lab was to create and publish an R package implementing the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS) for data visualizations. Thats how the tidycharts package came into existence, in collaboration with Bartosz Sawicki and Piotr Piątyszek.

The goal of tidycharts is to enable R users to create charts inspired by International Business Communication Standards (IBCS). The plots are generated in SVG format, so embedding them in HTML documents is straight forward.

Additionaly, I am the author of a blog on the medium.com portal, describing the package's capabilities and containing a simplified tutorial on how to use the package. I invite you to give it a look: https://medium.com/responsibleml/a-way-of-creating-clear-transparent-and-unified-data-visualizations-f166a828c715
